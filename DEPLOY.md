# Deployment Instructions

## Automated GitHub Pages Deployment

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) that automatically deploys the site to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch.

## Manual Setup Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Since GitHub CLI is not available, follow these manual steps:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `kids-gaming-site` 
3. Make it **public**
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 2. Push Code to GitHub

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kids-gaming-site.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The workflow will automatically deploy your site

### 4. Access Your Site

After the workflow completes (2-3 minutes), your site will be available at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/kids-gaming-site
```

## Files Added for Deployment

- `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- `.nojekyll` - Tells GitHub Pages not to use Jekyll processing
- This `DEPLOY.md` file with instructions

## Customization for Organizations

If deploying under an organization:
- Repository URL becomes: `https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/kids-gaming-site`
- Site URL becomes: `https://ORGANIZATION.github.io/kids-gaming-site`

## Troubleshooting

**Site not updating?**
- Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
- Ensure the workflow completed successfully
- GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to reflect changes

**404 Error?**
- Verify repository is public
- Check that Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Ensure the workflow deployed successfully
